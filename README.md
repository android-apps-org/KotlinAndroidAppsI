# Android Apps in Kotlin Part I

## Dice Roller: Android Anatomy

## About Me: Android Layouts

### Capstone Showcase

- Build a navigable interface consisting of multiple screens of functionality and data
- Construct user interfaces that adhere to Android standards
  - and display appropriately on screens of different size and resolution
- Animate UI components to better utilize screen real estate and create engaging content
- Connect to and consume data from a remote data source such as a REST-ful API
- Load network resources, such as Bitmap Images, dynamically and on demand
- Store data locally on the device for use between application sessions and/or offline use
- Architect application functionality using the MVVM design pattern
- Implement logic to handle and respond to hardware and system events which impact the Android Lifecycle
- Utilize system hardware to provide the user with advanced functionality and features

### Capstone Ideas

```
Start thinking about an idea for an app you might like to build.
Have you ever wished there was an application that does something, but could not find one?
Maybe there is an application that you use but wish it had a better user experience or a different feature?  
As you go through the lesson, think about how you might apply these concepts to developing that app.  
Consider sketching out possible designs with the components and properties that might be used.

- Running App: personal interest
- Fake (Virtual/Remote) Location App:
  - current apps for faking user/device location are horrible
