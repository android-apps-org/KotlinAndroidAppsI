# Guess It: App Architecture

## Think About

- For the various features, what data is required to be displayed to the user?
- Do the features require multiple states?
  - Think about a social media app with the ability to edit or comment on the post.
- What logic is required to make these features functional? Which layer do you think that logic would reside?
- Are there any long running tasks that persist when the application is in the background?
- Does the data update while youâ€™re using the app? Do you have to do anything to make that change?
